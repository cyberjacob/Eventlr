Used to generate the body of the activation email. Should display a link the user can click to activate the account. This template has the following context:<br/>
<br/>
{{ activation_key }}<br/>
The activation key for the new account.<br/>
{{ expiration_days }}<br/>
The number of days remaining during which the account may be activated.<br/>
{{ site }}<br/>
An object representing the site on which the user registered; depending on whether django.contrib.sites is installed, this may be an instance of either django.contrib.sites.models.Site (if the sites application is installed) or django.contrib.sites.models.RequestSite (if not). Consult the documentation for the Django sites framework for details regarding these objects' interfaces.<br/>
Note that the templates used to generate the account activation email use the extension .txt, not .html. Due to widespread antipathy toward and interoperability problems with HTML email, django-registration defaults to plain-text email, and so these templates should simply output plain text rather than HTML.
